<p>Ribbon designer since 1864</p><p>Our ribbons are woven from dyed yarns in France, at St Just St Rambert near St Etienne. Yarn preparation (milling, dyeing) is carried out by our local partners; design, warping, weaving and finishing are carried out in our workshops.<br></p><p>Between modernity and tradition, Julien Faure makes the most of experience handed down from generation to generation. We use shuttle looms with jacquard mechanics,<br></p>
