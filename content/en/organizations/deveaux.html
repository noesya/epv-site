<p>Founded in the 18th century, Deveaux is a family-run, independent company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of fabrics for the apparel industry. 200 years of know-how in tartan-dyed, Jacquard and printed fabrics, combined with a determined, visionary policy, have propelled us into a hyper-reactive, connected future. Concerned about the environment, Deveaux is constantly transforming its 100% French production to be ever more eco-responsible.  </p>
