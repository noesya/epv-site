<p>NOUGAT DIANE DE POYTIERS, A FAMILY STORY...</p><p>In 1920, two history buffs, Charlotte and Antonin Chambonnière, founded the "Nougat Diane de Poytiers" factory. They were inspired by the legend of Diane de Poitiers, the 16th-century Dauphiné duchess and one of the great ambassadors of nougat. According to the customs of the French king's court, she had nougat made for the 13 Christmas desserts. Her name still resonates today in a 16th-century street and mansion in Montélimar town center. Convinced of its symbolic value, Charlotte and Antonin chose to adopt it as the emblem of their future company. This family story, rooted in a passion for the nougat-making craft, has been passed down from generation to generation for almost four generations. Today, Frédéric Chambonnière, Charlotte's grandson, runs the company with his son Théo Chambonnière, both dedicated to preserving and passing on ancestral know-how.</p>
