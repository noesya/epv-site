<p>Traditional know-how handed down from generation to generation  </p><p>Since 1946, Les Tanneries de Puy has developed traditional expertise in the manufacture of top-of-the-range calf leather. A member of the Fédération Française de la Tannerie, we have been awarded the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Company) label, which testifies to our commitment to exceptional craftsmanship and industrial know-how in a local context.  <br></p>
