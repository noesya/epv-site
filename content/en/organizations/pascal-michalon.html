<p><b>Jean-Baptiste MICHALON, my grandfather, a farmer, made and mulched chairs during the harsh winters at the foot of the Lizieux peak, from the 30's to the 50's.André MICHALON, my father, set up a carpentry workshop in the 70's in the heart of the village of Malataverne in the commune of Beaux. Pascal MICHALON took over his father's business in 1993, after working for six years in an architectural firm, and gave it a new direction, focusing on architecture and design.</b></p><p><b>"I'm looking to do design work with simple values for people, for uses." </b></p>
