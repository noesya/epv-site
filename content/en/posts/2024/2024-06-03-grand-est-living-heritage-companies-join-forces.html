        <p>Les Macarons de Boulay, Les Escaliers Somme, Manufacture Bianchi (watchmaking/jewelry)... These are just a few of the ten Moselle companies awarded the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV) label.</p><p>Since its creation in 2005, this label has highlighted unique companies that know how to reconcile innovation and tradition, know-how and creation, heritage and future, local and international.</p><p>The professions most directly concerned by this state label are related to art and culture, gastronomy and industry," explains the Ministry of the Economy website.</p><p>To better promote and defend this label and the companies that hold it, a small group of EPVs in the Grand Est region (around 150 companies with the label) have taken the initiative, in consultation with the national association, to create the Grand Est regional EPV association, the official launch of which is scheduled for June 6, in Strasbourg.</p><p>Other regional associations of this type are already active in France, notably in the Hauts-de-France region.</p><p>The creation of an EPV incubator has also been announced by the government, for late 2023, with the ambition of identifying companies likely to obtain the label, the goal being to reach 2,500 EPVs by 2025.</p><p>Just over 1,000 companies currently hold the label.</p><p><a href="https://www.lasemaine.fr/grand-est-les-entreprises-du-patrimoine-vivant-se-federent/">Source</a></p>
